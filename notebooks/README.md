## Overview

My python jupyter notebooks with main data analysis. The folders are the following:

- [covid19:](./covid19) Covid-19 lockdown effects on air pollution in São Paulo State, Brazil.

- [modelling:](./modelling) Using machine learning to better understand biosphere-atmosphere interactions in South America.

- [multiple_variables:](./multiple_variables) Here we use more than one climatic and/or surface variable in order to create new ones or investigate relations among them. 

- [regrid_to_era_interim:](./regrid_to_era_interim) Spatial regrid are done inside these notebooks for atmospheric and surface variables coming from different sources. The results are data with original time resolution and 0.75x0.75° resolution for spatial grid, where this grid is compatible with the `0.75° ERA-INTERIM` one.

- [single_variables:](./single_variables) Notebooks intended to explore and analyze atmospheric and surface variables one at a time.
