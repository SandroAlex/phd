## Overview

My python jupyter notebooks with main data analysis. The folders are the following:

- [multiple_variables:](./multiple_variables) Here we use more than one climatic and/or surface variable in order to create new ones or investigate relations among them. 
 
- [single_variables:](./single_variables) Notebooks intended to explore and analyze atmospheric and surface variables one at a time.
